# debian-i3-config

Custom i3 config for Debian (and other stuff)

# i3vm

I installed i3vm on a fresh Debian setup (originally with Gnome so I do have a backup in case I crash something really bad).
Config files and custom tools regarding i3 are in the `config-i3` folder. Further instructions [there](config-i3).
